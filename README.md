* ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @amitstudydude
* ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Github Linux-RDP
* ðŸ“« How to reach me **jhajioajka@mail.com**
## **If you are looking for github Linux_Rdp , I have it but I dont use it On my personal account to avoid ban as i store all my Rdp config files in this repo**

# **I am using Apache-Guacamole here . If you know about it , you are a pro**
## How to get an RDP
* Fork https://github.com/jhajikv-ji/no
* Run The Workflow
* Wait 2 min
* You can see 2 links

## For Desktop users 
* Read login:passwd details given below the link
* Click 1st link
* Ctrl-Shift-Alt-Enter for clipboard
* Enjoy

## For Mobile users 
* Read login:passwd details given below the link
* Click 2nd link [it's the same link , but just a faster way to access guacamole settings ]
* Do the following settings => Select text-input && Drag mouse [right]
* ![alt text](https://github.com/jhajikv-ji/no/blob/main/image.jpg?raw=true)
* Use Hackers' keyboard [play store]
* Now pro user can click on upper-right button and click on default .
* But for new users - Click 1st link [ obviously from workflow output ]
* Ctrl-Shift-Alt-Enter [ or swipe left ] - for clipboard 
* Enjoy


**If Something fails , create an issue , I will try to solve it**
